#puts is the way to print output in Ruby.
# It is a method that outputs the given string to the console.
# puts "Hello, World!"  # This will print "Hello, World!" to the console

# You can also use puts to print variables or other data types.
# greeting = "Hello, World!"
# puts greeting  # This will also print "Hello, World!" to the console


# puts automatically adds a newline at the end of the output.
# If you want to print without a newline, you can use print instead.
# Example of using print
# print "Hello, World!"  # This will print "Hello, World!" without a newline


# If you want to print multiple items, you can separate them with commas.
# puts "Hello", "World!"  # This will print "Hello" and "World!" on separate lines
# You can also use string interpolation to include variables in your output.      


#example 
name = "Abaob Magdy"
age = 25
puts "Hello, My name is #{name}! and this is the first day for me in Ruby"  # This will print "Hello, Abaob
print "iam "  
print "#{age} years old"
